# Blazor Weather

A Blazor Weather sample app that shows the current weather for your current location and a collection of pinned locations.

The weather is supplied by [Accuweather](https://www.accuweather.com/).

Geolocation is handled using [Blazor.Geolocation](https://github.com/AspNetMonsters/Blazor.Geolocation).

Local storage is handled using [Blazored.LocalStorage](https://github.com/blazored/LocalStorage).

The [demo site](https://aka.ms/blazorweather) is hosted on a free Azure site, so be gentle :smile:.
